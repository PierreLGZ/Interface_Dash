# Interface_Dash

This project is part of our Machine Learning course under Python and consists in creating a graphical interface to apply prediction algorithms on a dataset. 
This interface must be easily used by people who are not initiated to Python programming.
Done with Davy DARANKOUM - Cl√©ment PERENON - Pierre LE GALEZE

## User guide
### Home page
Once on the home page, the user will first select his dataset by clicking on the "Drag and Drop or Select files" button. When the dataset is loaded, the user will have the possibility to choose via the list of columns, the variable to predict as well as the explanatory variables.  
Then, depending on the type of variable to predict, the models the user can choose will be either regression or classification models. 
The user has the choice between 3 models of each type, if he wants to obtain the results of only one, he just has to select it in the list and then click on the button "ResultsAlgo1" (for the first list) located below, a new window will open with the results of the selected model. On the other hand, if he would like to have the results of each algorithm, he has to select one model per list and to press the 3 buttons "ResultsAlgo1", "ResultsAlgo2", "ResultsAlgo3".
